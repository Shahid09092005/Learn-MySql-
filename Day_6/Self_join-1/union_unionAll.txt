UNION vs UNION ALL in MySQL
Both UNION and UNION ALL are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries. However, there is a key difference between them:

              1. UNION
Combines the results of multiple SELECT statements.
Removes duplicate records from the final result.
Sorting occurs internally to eliminate duplicates, which may reduce performance.
      Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;

  example:
SELECT name FROM students
UNION
SELECT name FROM teachers;

                2. UNION ALL
Combines the results of multiple SELECT statements.
Includes duplicate records in the final result.
Does not sort the result, making it faster than UNION.
        Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;

        example:
SELECT name FROM students
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM teachers;

Key Differences:
  Feature                  	UNION	                                    UNION ALL
  Removes Duplicates      	✅ Yes	                                    ❌ No
  Performance	          ❌ Slower (Sorting happens)	                ✅ Faster (No sorting)
  Use Case	              When unique records are needed	            When all records are needed, including duplicates
